\subsection{User-Related Metrics (Rating \& Satisfaction)}

\subsubsection*{Introduction}
In the evaluation of code generation models, \textbf{User-Related Metrics} are a class of \textbf{feedback-based evaluation} methods. These metrics are essential for assessing the practical quality of generated code by incorporating human judgment and expertise.

Unlike automated metrics that check for correctness or similarity, user-related metrics focus on the practical \textbf{usability, helpfulness, and overall experience} of a developer using an LLM as a tool. This approach helps evaluate aspects like readability, maintainability, and real-world effectiveness.

\subsubsection*{1. User Rating}
\textbf{Definition} \\
User Rating is a subjective metric used in the \textbf{RealHumanEval} benchmark to measure the perceived ``usability and helpfulness'' of model-generated code.

In the study, experienced programmers (213 participants) were asked to complete real programming tasks using LLM assistance (auto-completion or chat). Afterward, they rated the model's contribution on a \textbf{scale from 1 to 5}.

\textbf{Purpose} \\
The goal is to capture a subjective measure of a model's practical usability. It helps identify discrepancies between a user's preference and the model's actual technical performance, providing insights for user-centric optimizations.

\subsubsection*{2. User Satisfaction}
\textbf{Definition} \\
User Satisfaction is a subjective metric used in the \textbf{Copilot Evaluation Harness} benchmark to measure a developer's ``overall experience'' when using GitHub Copilot.

Developers used Copilot within Visual Studio Code to complete tasks (code generation, bug fixing, documentation) and provided feedback on the tool's helpfulness, accuracy, and quality, including a satisfaction rating on a \textbf{scale from 1 to 5}.

\textbf{Purpose} \\
This metric aims to comprehensively evaluate a model's performance in a real-world development environment, assessing its practical applicability and efficiency gains by directly polling developers.
