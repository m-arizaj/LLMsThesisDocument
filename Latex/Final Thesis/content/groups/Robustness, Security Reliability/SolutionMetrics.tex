\subsection{Solution Metrics}

\subsubsection*{Introduction}
\textbf{Solution Metrics} refer to a family of evaluation measures that assess the structural, aesthetic, and physical characteristics of code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike functional correctness metrics (which test \textit{if} the code works), solution metrics evaluate \textit{how} the code is written.

These metrics are crucial for distinguishing between ``working'' code and ``good'' code. As LLMs are increasingly used for complex software engineering tasks (as seen in \textit{LoCoBench}), it becomes necessary to measure qualities such as conciseness, structural complexity, and elegance. Excessive verbosity can hinder maintainability, while overly complex structures (common in Genetic Programming) can lead to ``bloat.'' Conversely, ``elegant'' solutions adhere to best practices and idiomatic patterns.

\subsubsection*{1. Solution Length (Average Lines of Code)}
\textbf{Definition} \\
\textbf{Solution Length}, specifically measured as \textbf{Average Lines of Code (LoC)}, quantifies the verbosity of the generated solution. It is a direct measure of the physical size of the code produced by the model.

\begin{equation}
    \text{Avg. LoC} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \text{Count}_{\text{lines}}(S_i)
\end{equation}

\noindent where $S_i$ is the generated solution for problem $i$.

\textbf{Purpose} \\
In the context of Anand et al. (2025), this metric is used to analyze software productivity and efficiency.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Conciseness}: Shorter code is generally preferred for lower cognitive load.
    \item \textbf{Model Tendency}: Identifies if a model ``hallucinates'' unnecessary boilerplate or produces optimized code.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Applications} \\
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Benchmarking}: Comparing efficiency between models (e.g., GPT vs. Gemini).
    \item \textbf{Maintenance Prediction}: Estimating future maintenance effort.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Limitations} \\
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Ambiguity}: ``Code Golfing'' (extreme brevity) can hurt readability.
    \item \textbf{Formatting Sensitive}: Dependent on bracing styles and formatting rules.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{2. Solution Elegance Score}
\textbf{Definition} \\
The \textbf{Solution Elegance Score} is a sophisticated metric introduced in the \textbf{LoCoBench} framework (Qiu et al., 2025) under the ``Software Engineering Excellence'' dimension. It evaluates quality beyond correctness, focusing on maintainability and idioms.

It is often a computed score assessing:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Readability}: Variable naming, commenting, and flow.
    \item \textbf{Idiomaticity}: Use of language-specific features (e.g., list comprehensions vs. loops).
    \item \textbf{Modularity}: Proper separation of concerns.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Purpose} \\
To differentiate between a ``brute force'' solution and an ``expert-level'' solution, ensuring new code fits seamlessly into large codebases without introducing technical debt.

\subsubsection*{3. Solution Size (Structural Complexity)}
\textbf{Definition} \\
In the context of \textbf{LLM\_GP} (Hemberg et al., 2024), \textbf{Solution Size} measures the complexity of the solution's representation, typically in Genetic Programming (GP) contexts.

\begin{equation}
    \text{Size}(S) = \text{Count}(\text{Nodes} \cup \text{Leaves}) \quad \text{or} \quad \text{Count}(\text{Tokens})
\end{equation}

\textbf{Purpose} \\
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Bloat Control}: Penalizes solutions that grow unnecessarily large during evolutionary processes.
    \item \textbf{Parsimony}: Encourages the simplest structural representation that solves the problem.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Applications} \\
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Symbolic Regression}: Preferring simpler mathematical formulas.
    \item \textbf{Evolutionary Code Synthesis}: Preventing convoluted logic.
\end{itemize}
